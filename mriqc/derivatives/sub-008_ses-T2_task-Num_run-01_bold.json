    "TaskDescription": "Subjects were presented with one dot array (prime) followed by a second dot array (target). The ratio between the numerosity of each dot array was varied, such that 24 trials had a ratio of 0.33 (i.e., 12 dots vs. 36 dots), 24 trials had a ratio of 0.5 (i.e., 18 dots vs. 36 dots), and 24 trials had a ratio of 0.66 (i.e., 24 dots vs. 36 dots). Six different dot sizes were used. To ensure that participantsâ€™ judgments were based on differences in numerosity rather than cumulative surface area, the distribution of dot sizes was biased towards smaller dots in large arrays and bigger dots in small arrays. However, totally equating the cumulative surface area between small and large arrays by entirely biasing the distribution of single dot sizes (100% bias) would have made it possible for the subjects to use single dot sizes as a cue for their judgments. Therefore, we found a trade-off (50% bias) between equating as much as possible (1) the cumulative surface areas and (2) the distributions of single dot sizes in each pair. Each stimulus was presented for 800 ms on a white screen separated by a 200 ms interstimulus interval. The target stimulus was followed by a red fixation square lasting 2200-3000 ms. Participants could respond as soon as the target was presented until the beginning of the next trial unless otherwise noted in README file. Twenty-four control trials were included to take motor responses into account. In these trials a blue square was presented. This yielded 96 trials. Trials were divided into two separate 48 trial runs titled task-Num_run-01 and task-Num_run-02. Each run ended with the presentation of a red square for 22000 ms.",
